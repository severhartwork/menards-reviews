Welcome to Seth Everhart's BigGreen Reviews.

Why? Menards does not have user reviews on their site and it drives me nuts. 
I can't be the only one. 

Notes: 

This is a page I will eventually deploy and the scope exceeds the requirements for completion of the 
first section of CL. For the first portion of front-end, I will focus on the homepage and a few other 
sections for testing purposes and build out more of the site as i progress through CL classes. 

I have included the following features to satisfy the requirements of the class: 

Navigation menu that changes view based on screen size, expands and contracts and features 
hover-over shading using css and js

Media queries for small, medium and large screens

Javascript button/question on the "Post a Review" page







* Functioning links on Tools by Type page limited to Power Saws, Power Tool Combo Kits 
and Routers for initial project.
